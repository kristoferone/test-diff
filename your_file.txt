<p><strong>Mental health</strong></p>

<p>Supporting employees' optimal mental health is a matter of great importance at Canadian Blood Services. While mental illness can be prevented and treated, the stigma surrounding mental illness often remains a barrier to people seeking help. We encourage you to learn more, speak up or seek help if you or someone you know is displaying symptoms of mental illness.</p>

<p>Canadian Blood Services offers a variety of resources to help employees maintain their overall sense of well-being and keep mentally healthy. The following programs offer tools and services that support employee mental health.</p>

<p><u>EAP</u>: Qualified staff at ComPsych Guidance Resources — a third-party, confidential provider of EAP services — help find solutions to all kinds of challenges that employees and their families may face at any age or stage of life.</p>

<p><u>LifeSpeak</u>: Health and wellness video modules led by accredited professionals in their field.</p>

<p><u>Benefits</u>: Employees enrolled in Group Benefits with Canadian Blood Services have access to prescription drugs and to paramedical services that support mental wellbeing.</p>
